        </div>
        <div class="vision-text">
            <p style="text-align: center;">The university will provide a learning environment in which faculty, staff
                and students
                can discover, examine critically, preserve and transmit knowledge, wisdom and values to improve the
                quality
                of life for all. The university will guide students to develop an understanding and appreciation for the
                complex cultural and physical worlds in which they live and to realize their highest potential of
                intellectual, physical and emotional development.<br><br>
                <b> To achieve its mission, the university will:</b><br>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Offer broad and balanced academic programs that are mutually reinforcing and emphasize high quality
                    and creative instruction at all levels.</li><br>
                <li>Generate new knowledge through a broad array of schularly, research and creative endeavours, which
                    provide a foundation for dealing with the immediate as well as long-term needs of society.</li><br>
                <li>Achieve leadership in each discipline, strengthen interdisciplinary studies, and pioneer new fields
                    of learning.</li><br>
                <li>Participate extensively in state-wide, national and international programmes and encourage others in
                    the university system, at other educational institutions and in state, national and international
                    organizations, to seek benefit from the university's unique educational resources, such as faculty
                    and staff expertise, libraries, archives, museums and research facilities.</li><br>
                <li>Strengthen cultural understanding through opportunities to study languages, cultures, the arts, and
                    the implications of social, political, economic and technological change off campus and abroad.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Maintain a level of excellence and standards in all programs that will give them state-wide,
                    national, and international significance.</li><br>
                <li>Embody, through its policies and programs, respect for, and commitment to, the ideals of a
                    pluralistic, multiracial, open and democratic society.</li>

            <div class="col-12  text-center ">

            <div class="col-md-12 vision-text">

                    <li><b>Enhance and diversify the university's academic offerings :</b></li><br>
                    <p> Develop timely, interdisciplinary, applied programs that address state and public priorities
                        such as
                        sustainability and the environment, globalization, civic engagement, health care,
                        infrastructure,
                        education, and community-based support systems, to name a few. Current and new academic programs
                        would complement the interdisciplinary research efforts on campus. New academic programs and
                        certificates would complement and expand the range of certificates and degrees available at the
                        university, rather than replicate the current offerings.</p>
               

                    <li><b>Respond quickly and responsibly to workforce development needs :
                        </b></li><br>
                    <p> In today's economic climate, the university's obligation to contribute to economic development
                        is even greater than it has been in the past. Through its economic stimulus programmes, the
                        government is seeking to accelerate job creation by increasing funds available for skill
                        development. The university will cater to the demand for instruction in existing as well as
                        emerging employment areas.</p>

                    <li><b>Promote and expand lifelong learning opportunities :
                        </b></li><br>
                    <p>Individuals seek learning opportunities for many reasons. Some hope to acquire skills and
                        knowledge that will enable them to find employment in new areas, or to become more skilled in
                        their current jobs. Others seek intellectual enrichment and personal growth. The university
                        would seek to identify the learning needs of prospective students at all life stages and to
                        offer a diverse array of learning opportunities, ranging from full-time programs like
                        undergraduate and graduate degrees, to certificate programs targeting employed adults. The
                        university will collaborate with representatives from government, business, industry, and other
                        arenas to create programmes for lifelong learners.</p>



                    <li><b>Increase the number of professional courses:

                        </b></li><br>
                    <p>Business leaders cite a pressing need for employees who have technical knowledge and skills in
                        particular areas. To help address this need, some organizations have called for the development
                        of professional master's degrees to prepare highly skilled professionals for employment in
                        industries of the type that drive the state's economy, such as high-value agriculture, MSME,
                        Ayush, renewable energy, IT and ITES, biotechnology and tourism among others. The university
                        will collaborate with local and regional employers to design and offer such professional degrees
                        in areas of greatest demand</p>
                
                <li><b>Increase revenues :

                    </b></li><br>
                <p>By introducing new courses, offering professional research and consultancy services, and providing
                    other auxiliary services, the university will aim to create new revenues streams and ensure
                    financial self sufficiency in the long run.</p>
